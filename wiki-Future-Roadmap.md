# Future Roadmap

This page outlines the planned future development for the Resolume Composition Converter.

## AI-Powered Video Upscaling Integration

Our major upcoming feature is the integration of AI-powered video upscaling capabilities. This will allow users to not only convert compositions between different resolutions but also enhance the quality of the media files using state-of-the-art AI upscaling techniques.

### Phase 1: Foundations & Preparations

#### Establish AI Upscaling Module
- Implement a new Python module (`ai_upscaling.py`) that handles all AI-related tasks
- Support multiple AI libraries (Real-ESRGAN, OpenCV SuperRes, Video2X)
- Ensure cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Add GPU acceleration with CPU fallback

#### FFmpeg & Format Handling
- Integrate or update existing FFmpeg usage for:
  - Decoding ProRes, DXV, or other input formats
  - Encoding to ProRes as an intermediate step
  - Optional automatic calling of Resolume Alley for DXV encoding

#### Composition Parsing Updates
- Enhance the existing composition-upscaling script to detect all media files
- Store file path, resolution, and format information for each media file

### Phase 2: AI Upscaling Pipeline Integration

#### Media Extraction & Preprocessing
- Check each media file referenced by the composition
- Convert to suitable format for AI upscaling if needed
- Skip conversion for already compatible formats

#### Upscaling Step
- Pass preprocessed video to the upscale_video() function
- Support various scale factors (1080p → 2160p = 2× factor)
- Allow selection of different AI models (Real-ESRGAN, EDSR, etc.)
- Output upscaled media at the new resolution

#### Re-Encode to DXV (Optional)
- Run upscaled file through Resolume Alley for DXV conversion if needed
- Provide options to keep ProRes or convert to DXV automatically

#### Composition File Update
- Update the composition file to reference the new upscaled media files

### Phase 3: UI & Workflow Enhancements

#### New "AI Upscaling" Tab or Section
- Add a panel in the interface for "AI Upscaling Settings"
- Include options for:
  - Enable/disable AI upscaling
  - Model selection
  - Upscale factor or target resolution
  - Output format
  - GPU device selection

#### Automatic vs. Manual Processing
- Allow users to choose between automatic or manual upscaling
- Provide options to skip certain media files

#### Progress & Logging
- Show a progress bar with "Now upscaling file X of Y"
- Display estimated time remaining and frames per second
- Log errors and warnings

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization

#### Test with Various Input Formats
- Ensure compatibility with ProRes, DXV, H.264 MP4, etc.
- Verify correct conversion and upscaling
- Confirm proper file references in the final composition

#### Performance Profiling
- Optimize for different hardware configurations
- Implement batch processing for better performance
- Evaluate memory usage and disk I/O

#### Edge Cases
- Handle very short clips
- Support large upscales (e.g., 720p to 8K)
- Properly process generator clips and router clips
- Handle missing or offline clips

### Phase 5: Release & Maintenance

#### Documentation
- Create comprehensive user guide for AI upscaling
- Provide tips on GPU usage and recommended hardware

#### User Feedback Loop
- Collect user feedback on upscaling quality and speed
- Implement improvements based on user suggestions

#### Future Enhancements
- Add frame interpolation (e.g., RIFE) for slow-motion or frame rate upscaling
- Provide preview window for before/after comparison
- Offer API mode for advanced scripting

## Recommended AI Upscaling Technologies

Based on our research, we recommend the following technologies for integration:

### Real-ESRGAN
- Best quality upscaling with broad compatibility
- Excellent for preserving details and reducing artifacts
- Available via Python integration

### OpenCV Super-Resolution
- Faster processing with simpler integration
- Models include EDSR, FSRCNN, ESPCN, and LapSRN
- EDSR offers best quality while FSRCNN/ESPCN are faster

### Video2X
- Excellent command-line tool with multiple algorithm support
- Provides flexibility to experiment with different AI models
- Includes frame interpolation alongside upscaling

### FFmpeg Integration
- Essential for format conversion
- Handles ProRes encoding directly
- Works with external tools for DXV encoding
